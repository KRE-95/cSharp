Without parameter:
The first version of the Next() method doesn't set an upper and lower boundary, so the method will return values ranging from 0 to 2,147,483,647, which is the maximum value an int can store.

With one parameter:
The second version of the Next() method specifies the maximum value as an upper boundary, so in this case, you can expect a random value between 0 and 100.

With two parameter:
The third version of the Next() method specifies both the minimum and maximum values, so in this case, you can expect a random value between 50 and 100.
