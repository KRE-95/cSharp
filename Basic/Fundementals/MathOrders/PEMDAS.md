# Order of Operations in Mathematics and C#

As you learned in the previous exercise, the order of operations in mathematics is crucial for correctly evaluating expressions. In mathematics, PEMDAS is an acronym that helps students remember the correct order. PEMDAS stands for:

1. **Parentheses:** Whatever is inside the parentheses is performed first.
2. **Exponents**
3. **Multiplication and Division:** These operations are performed from left to right.
4. **Addition and Subtraction:** Similarly, these operations are performed from left to right.

C# (C-sharp) follows the same order as PEMDAS, with one exceptionâ€”exponents. While there's no exponent operator in C#, you can use the `System.Math.Pow` method to achieve exponentiation. The module "Call methods from the .NET Class Library using C#" will feature this method and others.
