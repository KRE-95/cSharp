 evaluate the rolled values to calculate the score.
 
  If the score is greater than an arbitrary total, then you'll display a winning message to the user. 

If the score is below the cutoff, you'll display a losing message to the user.

* 		If any two dice you roll result in the same value, you get two bonus points for rolling doubles.

* 		If all three dice you roll result in the same value, you get six bonus points for rolling triples.

* 		If the sum of the three dice rolls, plus any point bonuses, is 15 or greater, you win the game. Otherwise, you lose


Use if, else, and else if statements to give a prize instead of a win-lose message:

To make the game more fun, you can change the game from "win-or-lose" to awarding fictitious prizes for each score. You can offer four prizes. However, the player should win only one prize:

* 		If the player scores greater or equal to 16, they'll win a new car.
* 		If the player scores greater or equal to 10, they'll win a new laptop.
* 		If the player scores exactly 7, they'll win a trip.
* 		Otherwise, the player wins a kitten.
